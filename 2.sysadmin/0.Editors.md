## VI and VIM
Vi has less features than VIM 

## "sed" Command (Stream editor)
- Searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. 
- Edit files even without opening them.
- Supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.

example:
```
sed -i 's/unix/linux/g' unixToLinux
```
This command with the "-i" flag will replace the word "unix" with "linux" in all instances, because of the "/g".
