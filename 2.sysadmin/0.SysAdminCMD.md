## System Utility Commands
date, uptime, hostname, uname, which, cal, bc

- date: Display the time in a given format
- cal: shows calendar
- uptime: system uptime
- hostname: display system's DNS name, or set its hostname/NIS domain name
- uname: OS system info, -a for all info
- which: shows the full path of shell commands, ie. which telnet = /usr/bin/telnet
- bc: binary calculator

## Processes, Threads Daemon, and Jobs
- Process = active running instance of a program
- Threads = A basic unit of CPU Utilization, App > Process > thread
- Daemon = Utility programs that run silently in the background to monitor and take care of certain subsystems to ensure that the operating system runs properly
- Job = Run a service or process at a scheduled time

Commands:
systemctl, ps, top, kill, crontab(job), at.(one time cron, adhoc)

## System Control (systemctl)
systemctl: like double clicking a windows app, introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager. 

- systemctl start|stop|status <service-name/.service>
- systemctl enable <service-name> = start services automatically at boot
- systemctl restart|reload <service-name> = upon config changes

- systemctl list-units --all = Show all installed unit files. A colored dot is shown next to services which were masked, not found, or otherwise failed.
  - UNIT: the systemd unit name
  - LOAD: if the unit's config was parsed by systemd and kept in memory
  - ACTIVE: if the unit started 
  - SUB: lower-level state indicates more detail about the unit.

### Control system with systemctl
systemctl poweroff
systemctl halt
systemctl reboot

### Adding a service to let systemctl manage
1. Create a unit file in /etc/systemd/system/serviceName.service 

## Process Status (ps)
ps: displays all the currently running processes
```
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
26097 pts/0    Ss     0:00 -bash
```
- PID: process ID
- TTY: terminal type 
- TIME: amount of CPU in min and seconds that the process has been running
- CMD: command's name

Show all running processes:
- "ps -ef": show everything in full format listing
- "ps -e": show all default format
- "ps aux": show all in legacy BSD format
- "ps -ef -u <username>" show all for single user, in full format

## Display Linux processes (top)
top: 
- real-time view of running system
- Summary of system info and the list of processes or threads managed by the Linux Kernel

## Linux Kernel
- Core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes.
- It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer.
