## Log Monitoring
*** check messages first for everything ***
1. messages, secure
2. boot, cron, dmesg, maillog, httpd
3. Log Directory = /var/log

### Messages 
/var/log/messages: Logs global system messages. 
-  system startup logs
-  hardware, software, application/processes logs
-  others logs can include mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc.

```
Entry Columns:
date and time | hostname | program | [PID] | log message
Feb 27 13:28:23 hostname dhclient[2828]: XMT: Solicit on eth0, interval 113180ms.

Example:
grep -i error /var/log/messages
```
### Secure 
/var/log/secure: user login activity, fail(ie. fail password), success
```
tail -f secure = "tail -f" will keep sniffing, and stream changes onto the prompt, so we can see a log stream of user logging in near realtime.
```
### Boot 
/var/log/boot.log: system boot messages, including errors messages

### Cron 
var/log/cron: cron jobs are logged in this file. 
```
Example:
Date | Time | hostname | daemon | user | command

Mar  3 22:50:01 hostname CROND[11556]: (ec2-user) CMD (echo "this is my first crontab entry" > crontab-entry)
```
### Display kernel message (dmesg)
dmesg: print or control the kernel ring buffer (a data structure that records messages related to the operation of the kernel)

Shows messages for during booting and after booting.

### maillog
/var/log/maillog: email logged, ie. logs the sendmail service

## Central logging (rsyslog)
Remote System Log: Log aggregation from forwarding log messages in an IP network
- Package:  rsyslog
