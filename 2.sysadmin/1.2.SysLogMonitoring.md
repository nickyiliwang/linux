## Log Monitoring
- messages, secure
- boot, cron, dmesg, maillog, httpd
- Log Directory = /var/log

### messages 
/var/log/messages: Logs global system messages. 
-  system startup logs
-  hardware, software, application/processes logs
-  others logs can include mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc.

Entry Column:
```
date and time | hostname | program | [PID] | log message
Feb 27 13:28:23 hostname dhclient[2828]: XMT: Solicit on eth0, interval 113180ms.
```

Example:
```
grep -i error /var/log/messages
```
### secure 
/var/log/secure: user login activity, fail(ie. fail password), success
- tail -f secure = "tail -f" will keep sniffing, and stream changes onto the prompt, so we can see a log stream of user logging in near realtime.

### boot 
/var/log/boot.log: system boot messages, including errors messages


### cron 
var/log/cron: cron jobs are logged in this file. 

Example:
```
Date | Time | hostname | daemon | user | command

Mar  3 22:50:01 hostname CROND[11556]: (ec2-user) CMD (echo "this is my first crontab entry" > crontab-entry)
```

### Display kernel message (dmesg)
dmesg: print or control the kernel ring buffer (a data structure that records messages related to the operation of the kernel)

Shows messages for during booting and after booting.

### maillog
/var/log/maillog: email logged, ie. logs the sendmail service
