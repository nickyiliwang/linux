## System Utility Commands
whoami, date, uptime, hostname, uname, which, cal, bc

- whoami = Shows current user, you
- date: Display the time in a given format
- cal: shows calendar
- uptime: system uptime
- hostname: display system's DNS name, or set its hostname/NIS domain name, to make sure I'm logged in to the right EC2
- uname: OS system info, -a for all info
- which: shows the full path of shell commands, ie. which telnet = /usr/bin/telnet
- bc: binary calculator

## Changing the hostname (hostnamectl)
hostnamectl: query and change the system hostname

Three types of hostname:
1. High-level "pretty" hostname (ie. "Lennart's Laptop")
2. Static hostname: used to initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g. "lennarts-laptop")
3. Transient hostname: default received from network configuration. 

If a static hostname is set, and is valid (something other than localhost), then the transient hostname is not used.

Options:
--static, --transient, --pretty

Example:
hostnamectl set-hostname --pretty "Nick's EC2" = sets the pretty hostname

## Finding system information (uname, dmidecode)
1. cat /etc/os-release | /etc/system-release | /etc/system-release-cpe
2. uname -a, dmidecode

Details:
1. cat /etc/os-release: will tell you that AmzLinux 2 has an ID_like value of "centos rhel fedora" (red hat enterprise Linux), 

2. uname: OS system info, -a for all info

3. dmidecode: DMI(SMBIOS) info that contains a description of the  system's  hardware  components,  and other info like serial numbers and BIOS revision. 

## Finding System Architecture (arch)
There is a difference between 32-bit and 64-bit CPU
- number of calculations per second performed

arch: machine hardware name (same as uname -m)
- arch = x86_64 (Amazon EC2, t2.micro)

## Terminal Control keys
1. CTRL + u = clear text typed in the cli
2. CTRL + c = kill a command
3. CTRL + z = suspend a command 
4. CTRL + d = exit an interactive program (ie. binary calculator - bc)

## Terminal Commands
clear, exit, script
script: make typescript of terminal session
- script <filename> : starts recording
- exit : stop recording
