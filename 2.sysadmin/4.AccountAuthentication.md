## Types of Accounts
- Local Accounts (useradd)
- Domain/Directory Accounts (ie. for many machines, MSAD)

## Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network.

Linux can us LDAP to authenticate users.

Just like SAML is for SSO in the Cloud, LDAP is for things like MSAD.

## SAMBA
- Implementation of the SMB networking protocol.
- Provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. Now it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains.

- Runs on most Unix-like systems, such as Linux, MacOS 
- Samba's name comes from SMB (Server Message Block), the name of the proprietary protocol used by the Microsoft Windows network file system.

## Difference between: LDAP, IDM, WinBIND, OpenLDAP etc.
Active Directory = Microsoft
IDM = Identity Management
openLDAP = open source identity management, LDAP is a protocol
WinBIND = Used in Linux to comm with Windows (Samba)
