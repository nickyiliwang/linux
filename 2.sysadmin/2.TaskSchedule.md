## Task scheduler (crontab)
crontab:
- crontab -e = edit the crontab
- crontab -l = List the crontab entries
- crontab -r = remove current crontab
- crond = crontab daemon/service that manages scheduling
- systemctl status crond = manages the crond service

### Crontab entries (m/h/d/m/w)
min * hour * day * month * week * <commands>
minute(0-59), hour(0-23), day of month(1-31), month(1-12), day of week(0-6)

Example:
This command runs and outputs a file in the /home/ec2-user dir

Date: Thu Mar  3 22:29:37 UTC 2022
```
40 22 3 3 4 echo "this is my first crontab entry" > crontab-entry
```

- 40 22 * 3 *  = leave the number as "*" to leave it blank, but now it will repeat the cron task till you remove it.

## Scheduling an adhoc task once (at, batch)
at: read commands from stdin or a specified file which will be executed in a later time, using /bin/sh. Service daemon is called "atd"

Commands:
- at at HH:MM AM/PM MMDDYY + enter + <command> = Schedule a job
- atq = List all active entries
- atrm # = Remove an entry by number

Formats:
- at HH:MM AM/PM (no dates needed)
- at HH:MM AM/PM MMDDYY (dates)
- at HH:MM AM/PM day (ie. this sunday)
- at HH:MM AM/PM next month (time next month)
- at now +X hours

## Repeating Cron jobs with script files
You can upload your scripts in /etc/cron.____ (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- All schedules, except hourly are in /etc/anacrontab 
- Hourly schedules => /etc/cron.d/0hourly
