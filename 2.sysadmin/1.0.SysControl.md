## Processes, Threads, Daemon, and Jobs
- Process = active running instance of a program
- Threads = A basic unit of CPU Utilization, App > Process > thread
- Daemon = Utility programs that run silently in the background to monitor and take care of certain subsystems to ensure that the operating system runs properly
- Job = Run a service or process at a scheduled time

Commands:
systemctl, ps, top, kill, crontab(job), at.(one time cron, adhoc)

## System Control (systemctl)
systemctl: like double clicking a windows app, introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager. 

- systemctl start|stop|status [service-name/.service]
- systemctl enable [service-name] = start services automatically at boot
- systemctl restart|reload [service-name] = upon config changes

- systemctl list-units --all = Show all installed unit files. A colored dot is shown next to services which were masked, not found, or otherwise failed.
  - UNIT: the systemd unit name
  - LOAD: if the unit's config was parsed by systemd and kept in memory
  - ACTIVE: if the unit started 
  - SUB: lower-level state indicates more detail about the unit.

Example:
- systemctl status crond = manages the crond daemon
- systemctl status atd = manages the atd daemon

### Control system with systemctl
systemctl poweroff
systemctl halt
systemctl reboot

### Adding a service to let systemctl manage
1. Create a unit file in /etc/systemd/system/serviceName.service 

## Process Status (ps)
ps: displays all the currently running processes
```
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
26097 pts/0    Ss     0:00 -bash
```
- PID: process ID
- TTY: terminal type 
- TIME: amount of CPU in min and seconds that the process has been running
- CMD: command's name

Show all running processes:
- "ps -ef": show everything in full format listing
- "ps -e": show all default format
- "ps aux": show all in legacy BSD format
- "ps -ef -u [username]" show all for single user, in full format

## Linux Kernel
- Core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes.
- It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer.


## Display Linux processes (top)
top: 
- real-time view of running system
- Summary of system info and the list of processes or threads managed by the Linux Kernel

- to quit, press q
- no root needed unless you want to kill a process

Columns:
- PID: processID
- USER: owner of task
- PR: Nice Value of the process's actual priority, as viewed by the Linux kernel.
- NI: Nice Value is a user-space concept
- VIRT: Total Virtual memory used by the task
- RES: Memory consumed by the process in RAM (random access memory)
- SHR: amount of shared memory used
- S: process state (S: Sleeping, I: Idle)
- %CPU: CPU utilization %
- %MEM: Memory usage % 
- TIME+: CPU Time

top flags:
- top -u [username]
- top + press "c" = shows absolute path of each task
- top + press "k" + PID = kills the process by PID
- top + press "M" + "P" (uppercase) = sort running processes by Memory usage

## Nice Command
Nice Values:
1. Invokes a CPU priority change, giving more or less CPU time than other processes.
2. A niceness of -20 is the highest priority and +19 is the lowest priority
3. When several processes are demanding more resources than the CPU can provide. 

nice: run [command] with an adjusted niceness, affects process scheduling
- nice -n -19 sleep 90 = raises the user defined niceness to -19 a process, if we do a top command, it will show the PR to be 1, because (PR 20) + (NI -19) = PR 1, highest priority

## Kill command
kill: terminate processes manually
- kill [OPTION] [PID]
- kill -l = get list of all signals

Common Signals:
- kill -1  = Restart (SIGHUP)
- kill -2  = Interrupt from keyboard, like Ctrl C (SIGINT)
- kill -9  = Forcefully kill (SIGKILL)
- kill -15 = Kill gracefully (SIGTERM)

Example:
1. sleep 60 = sleep 60 seconds
2. ps -ef | grep sleep = get the sleep PID
3. kill -SIGKILL [sleep-PID] = kills the running process

Other commands:
killall = kill all processes
pkill = kill by the process's name instead of ID (ie. firewalld)

## Process Background/Foreground (bg, fg, jobs)
Move running process to background and get your cli back, move the process to the foreground to manage it.


### Background
- ctrl + z : stops the running process
- jobs: shows all background processes, paused or running
- bg: send a process to the background

Example:
1. sleep 100 = running sleep program, no prompt
2. ctrl + z = sleep program pauses, not terminated, prompt shows
3. jobs = shows the paused sleep, with an ID of 1
4. bg 1 = runs the sleep program but in the background
5. jobs = [1]-  Running  sleep 100 &

### Run a process in the background (nohup)
nohup: Detach the process from the terminal, to keep the process running even after the terminal is closed, record everything in nohup.out
- nohup sleep 100 &
- nohup sleep 100 > /dev/null 2>&1 & (No outputs on screen)

### Foreground:
fg: brings the background running program to the foreground
- fg
- fg job#
