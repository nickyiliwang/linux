## Adding text to Files
1. Vi/Nano
2. "outputs/echo" > (replaces the content)
3. "outputs/echo" >> (adding onto existing content)

## Input and Output Redirects
Numbers are used when you redirect
1. stdin: input - 0
2. stdout: output - 1
3. stderr: error - 2

ie. output error into file
```
ls -l /root 2> errorFile
telnet localhost 2> errorFile 
```

## tee command
Like the T-splitter in plumbing we can split the output into a while and the cli at the same time.

ie. we piped this message into output.txt and output it onto cli, -a flag will append the message to file
```
echo "split this output" | tee output.txt
```

## pipe command
Allows th use of two or more commands. ie. output of one command serves as input to the next. Like a pipe
```
ls -ltr | more
```
now we can view the listing in a pagination format

## Text Processors
cut, awk, grep/egrep, sort, uniq, wc, 

cut: Print selected parts of lines from each FILE
- cut -c1 filename => select the 1st letter in the file
- cut -b1 filename => select the 1st byte  in the file
- cut -d: -f 6 /etc/passwd => select the 6st field after the delimiter of ":" 
- ls -l |cut -c2-4

awk: programming language for data extraction 
1. Has simple if statements
2. Can cut and replace bytes
3. can print first or last column ($1/$NF)

- awk '{print $1}' leagueChamps.txt => first column 
- awk '{print $NF}' leagueChamps.txt => last column 
- awk '/LU/ {print}' leagueChamps.txt => searching name containing "LU"
- awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd => cut to the 1st column before the ":"
Advanced:
- echo "Hello Nick" | awk '{$2="Jason"; print $0}' => replacing text
- awk 'length($0) > 15' file => get lines that has 15 byte size
- ls -l | awk '{print NF}' 

grep: regex
- grep LU leagueChamps.txt => match words containing "LU", highlights it
- grep -c <keyword> <filename> => shows how many times it is found
- grep -i <keyword> <filename> => ignores case sensitivity
- grep -n <keyword> <filename> => shows exact line it is found
- grep -v <keyword> <filename> => find everything else
- grep <keyword> <filename> | awk '{print $1}' = Show 1st field after match


egrep: search 2 keywords
- egrep -i "<keyword1>|<keyword2>" <filename> 
- ie. egrep -i "lu|se" leagueChamps.txt

sort / uniq
