str1 = str2	=> str1 is equal to str2
str1 != str2	=> str1 is not equal to str2

Integers:
int1 -eq int2	=> int1 is numerically equal to int2
int1 -gt int2	=> int1 is numerically greater than int2
int1 -lt int2	=> int1 is numerically less than int2

Files:
-d FILE	=> FILE exists and is a directory.
-e FILE	=> FILE exists.
-r FILE	=> FILE exists and the read permission is granted.
