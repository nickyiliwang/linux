## Troubleshooting an EC2 web hosting
- is EC2 running and passing both status checks.
- Did the instance boot correctly.
- security group and network access control list (ACL) configuration.
- Verify that the instance has the correct DNS configuration.
- Verify that the web server is running and that there are no OS-level firewalls blocking access to ports.


### OS-level firewalls blocking access to ports. (AmzLinux 2)
1. Firstly, we verify that firewalld is running:
```
firewall-cmd --state
```
2. Then to configure it to allow connections on ports 80 and 443, we run
```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
