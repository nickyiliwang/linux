## Domain Name System (DNS)
Hostname to IP = A Record
IP to Hostname = Pointer Record (PTR)
Hostname to Hostname = CNAME Record

Files:
- /etc/named.conf
- /var/named

Service:
- named (name daemon)

### Hostname/DNS lookup (nslookup, dig)
***dig is preferred over nslookup because of it's more feature rich***

nslookup: query internet domain name servers.
```
Example: nslookup google.com

Server:         172.31.0.2    = My DNS Resolver server, R53

The Amazon-supplied VPC DNS server is at the VPC subnet CIDR base +2 address. Our VPC CIDR is 172.31.0.0, therefore, 172.31.0.2 is the resolver ip.

You can filter DNS traffic with R53 Resolver DNS Firewall

Address:        172.31.0.2#53 = DNS listens to Port 53, üòè Route53 

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 172.217.164.142
Name:   google.com
Address: 2607:f8b0:4004:82a::200e
```

dig: Performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s). For DNS troubleshooting.
```
Example: dig www.google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.amzn2.5.2 <<>> www.google.com

2. Configure /etc/named.conf(DNS Server)
3. Create Zone files (/var/named)
4. Modify zone files (Forward&Reverse)
5. Start named service
6. disable/open ports firewalld
7. Configure permissions
8. Test DNS config and zone files
9. AddDNS Server info to network file (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/my-nic)
