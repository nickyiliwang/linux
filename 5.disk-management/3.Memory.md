## Add/Extend Swap Space
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.

Swap space can be a dedicated swap partition (recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and swap files.

Swap should equal 2x physical RAM for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB, but never less than 32 MB.

Commands:
1. dd: Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the operands.
   - dd takes a chunk of space, touch makes empty files
2. mkswap
3. swapon/swapoff = add or remove swap space
4. free

```
free -m = display amount of memory in megabytes
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            965         169         244           0         551         646
Swap:             0           0           0
```

Adding Swap space:
```
Step 1: create a one gig file
dd if=/dev/zero of=/newswap bs=1M count=1024
output(/):
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 1073741824 Mar  6 20:58 newswap

Step2: take away read perms from group and others
chmod go-r newswap

Step3: sets up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file.
mkswap /newswap

Step4: Enable new swap
swapon /newswap

free -m outputs:
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            965         153          63           0         748         668
Swap:          1023           0        1023

Remove:
swapoff /newswap
rm /newswap
```

*To enable this on boot, edit /etc/fstab
