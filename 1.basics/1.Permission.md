## File Permissions
UNIX is multi-user, means every file and dir in your account can be protected from or made accessible to other users by changing its permissions. 
Every user has control to their files.

Each file/Dir has permission types and levels
*superuser has access regardless

Permission Types:
1. read
2. write
3. execute: run a script for files, cd into for dir

Permission principal:
1. u = user = self
2. g = group = people in the same project/group
3. o = others = public
4. a = all = u + g + o

Permission Display:
ie. rwxrwrwx = rwx(user)rwx(group)rwx(others) 
"-" means its undefined ie. rw-r--r--  

Command to change permission:
<chmod "principal""add/remove""type" "filename">
ie. <chomd a+w hello.sh> <= adding write permission to everyone in the OS

Numeric shortcuts:
0. No Perm
1. Execute
2. Write
3. Execute + Write
4. Read
5. Read + Execute
6. Read + Write
7. Read + Execute + Write

ie <chomod 777 hello.sh>

## File Ownership, and group Ownership
Owner + Group, ie. ec2-user  + ec2-user

OwnerShip: <chown>
Group: <chgrp>

## ACL
1. Assigning ACL to a file/dir, it adds a "+" sign at the end of the permission
2. ACL does not allow deletion for other users

Add perm to user:
<setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file>

Add perm to group:
<setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file>

To recursively add perm to a folder and subfolder:
<setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/dir>

Remove entry for one user:
<setfacl -x u:user path/to/file> 

Remove entry for all users
<setfacl -b path/to/file>
