## File Permissions
***All permissions on a file or dir are referred to as bits***

UNIX is multi-user, means every file and dir in your account can be protected from or made accessible to other users by changing its permissions. Every user has control to their files.

Each file/Dir has permission types and levels
*superuser has access regardless

Permission Types:
1. read
2. write
3. execute: run a script for files, cd into for dir

Permission principal:
1. u = user = self
2. g = group = people in the same project/group
3. o = others = public
4. a = all = u + g + o

Permission Display:
ie. rwxrwrwx = rwx(user)rwx(group)rwx(others) 
"-" means its undefined ie. rw-r--r--  

### Command to change permission (chmod)
```
chmod "principal""add/remove""type" "filename"
chomd a+w hello.sh = "a" adding write permission to everyone in the OS
```
Numeric shortcuts (1-8):
1. No Perm
2. Execute
3. Write
4. Execute + Write
5. Read
6. Read + Execute
7. Read + Write
8. Read + Execute + Write
```
chomod 777 hello.sh
```

Special Permissions:
Only available on executable files

1. setuid: bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective user id of the owner(set with setuid) instead of the executor. (ie. passwd command => root => edit /etc/shadow)
2. setgid: 
3. sticky bit: only allow the owner or root to delete this file

```
chmod u+s xys.sh = add special perm at user level
chmod g+s xys.sh = add special perm at group level

chmod u-s xys.sh = remove special perm at user level 
chmod g-s xys.sh = remove special perm at group level

find / -perm /6000 -type f = find all exe with setuid and setgid perms 
```
Example:
```
[root@hostname etc]# ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 27776 Feb 13  2020 /usr/bin/passwd

note the s bit in the command 
```



## File Ownership, and group Ownership
Owner + Group, ie. ec2-user  + ec2-user

OwnerShip: [chown]
Group: [chgrp]

## ACL
1. Assigning ACL to a file/dir, it adds a "+" sign at the end of the permission
2. ACL does not allow deletion for other users

Add perm to user:
<setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file>

Add perm to group:
<setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file>

To recursively add perm to a folder and subfolder:
<setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/dir>

Remove entry for one user:
<setfacl -x u:user path/to/file> 

Remove entry for all users
<setfacl -b path/to/file>
