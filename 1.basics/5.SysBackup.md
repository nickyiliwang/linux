## System Backup (dd)
To backup or clone an entire hard disk to another hard disk connected to the same system:
```
dd if=<source file name> of=<target file name> [options]
ie.
dd if=/dev/svda of=/dev/svdb

To backup/copy the disk partition
dd if /dev/xvda of=/root/xvda1.img

Restoring this image file to other machine after copying the .img
dd if=/root/xvda1.img of=/dev/xvda
```

In AWS we could always just take a snapshot of our AMI and create another instance with this snapshot.
